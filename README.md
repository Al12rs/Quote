# Stop self-botting, quote messages the legal way

*If you always wanted to quote user messages without getting in trouble for it, then Quote is what you need!*

*Other than modifying your Discord client, you can make a bot to do it for you without any issues.*

---

## What messages are supported?
  * Normal message with content, sent either by a normal user or any different bot.

  * Embed's color depends on the message author's color in the server by roles.

  * Message containing an image as an attachment will also be quoted, but if there are more than 1 attachments in 1 messages then all of them will be linked individualy (discord's limitations).

  * Rich Embed messages will not be quoted, and there will never be plans to add support for them.

---

## Quoting
* Ability to quote messages by reacting with ðŸ’¬ to them, without the need to use any command. Keep in mind, you need to have Manage Server permission to enable reaction quoting, by running `>reactions`.

* Comprehensive content quoting, supporting images and multiple attachment.

* Informative footer with information on the request, channel of the original message and timestamp of the original message.

* Quick link to original message embedded in the original poster's name.

* Ability to add a reply to the quoted message, by doing `>q <messageId> <myReply>`, which the bot will post under the quoted message.

* Very easy and concise commands: `>quote` or simply `>q`

---

## Pinning
* Define a pin channel, by running the command `>pinchannel`, and have the bot embed messages there on any message you add a ðŸ“Œ reaction to. (P.S: Only users with Manage Messages permission can use this to avoid spam.)

---

##  Anti-Bot Farm
* Quote will leave any server that has less than 20 members and if more than 70% of the server's population is composed of bots.

---

## Custom Prefix
* Don't like `>` as your server's prefix? You can change it by running `>prefix <your custom prefix>`.

---

## Self-Host
* If you'd like to selfhost Quote, you are more than welcome to by following one of the guides found on our [**Documentation Page**](https://quote.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
