# Stop self-botting, quote messages the legal way
If you always wanted to quote user messages without getting in trouble for it, then **Quote** is what you need.

## What messages are supported?
  * Normal message with content, sent either by a normal user or any different bot.

  * Embed's color depends on the message author's color in the server by roles.

  * Message containing an image as an attachment will also be quoted, but if there are more than 1 images in the message then only the first image will be quoted (discord's limitations).

  * Rich Embed messages will not be quoted, and there will never be plans to add support for them.
