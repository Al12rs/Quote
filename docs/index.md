# Stop self-botting, quote messages the legal way

| *If you always wanted to quote user messages, without getting in trouble for it, then Quote is what you need!* |
| --- |
| *Other than modifying your Discord client, you can get a bot to do it for you without issues.* |

---

## What messages are supported?
> * Normal message with content, sent either by a normal user or any different bot.

> * Embed's color depends on the message author's color in the server by roles.

> * Message containing an image as an attachment will also be quoted, but if there are more than 1 attachments in 1 messages then all of them will be linked individualy (discord's limitations).

> * Rich Embed messages will not be quoted, and there will never be plans to add support for them.

## Self-Host

> If you'd like to selfhost Quote, you are more than welcome to by following one of the guides found in our [Documentation Page](https://quote.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
